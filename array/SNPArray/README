This readme explains the content of the scripts for running the genotype analysis pipeline.
It assumes the idat files have been processed through Genome Studio and exported as plink format
For CNV calling it assumes that the log R and B allele ratio have been exported and are included in the final report 

submit from the <>/array folder 

#### Data pre-processing:

1. sbatch SNPArray/jobSubmission/runSNPQC.sh <config file>
Executes the following scripts
	1_QC.sh performs basic QC of samples and variants
	2_CheckEthnicity.sh takes QCd SNP data, merges with 1000 genomes, classifies samples to super populations
	3_CheckRelatedness.sh 
	4_formatForImputation.sh prepares QCd data for imputation via Michegan imputation server

#### Post processing of imputed genotypes:

2. sbatch SNPArray/jobSubmission/liftoverImputation.sh <config file>
Executes for each chromosome in parallel (as a separate job)
	5_liftoverhg38.sh requires output from Michegan imputation serverto liftover to hg 38


3. sbatch SNPArray/jobSubmission/runSNPImputationQC.sh <config file>
Executes
	6_summarizeImputation.r creates plots to summarise quality metrics of imputation
	7_combineImputationOutput.sh filters variants to those iwth rsq > 0.3 and maf > 0.01 and collates QC'd, lifted over, imputed output into a single plink file and single vcf file
