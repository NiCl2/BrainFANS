This readme explains the content of the scripts for running the DNAm analysis pipeline

	REQUISITES:
		Scripts submitted from the scripts/array folder.
		Unix config file located scripts/array/DNAm/config/config.txt that generates the file paths specific to the project 
		Users require a folder named with their username in the DNAm/logFiles directory 

#### Data pre-processing:

Parameters in [] are optional.

1. sbatch DNAm/jobSubmission/1_runDNAmQC.sh <project-name> <mkdownConfig>

This script assumes there is a sampleSheet.csv within the 0_metadata folders which lists the samples to process and the idats are in 1_raw

	* executes DNAm/preprocessing/1_loadDataGDS.r ${DATADIR}
	* executes DNAm/preprocessing/2_calcQCMetrics.r ${DATADIR} ${REFDIR} [${GENOFILE}]
	* executes Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('DNAm/preprocessing/3_QC.rmd', output_file='QC.html')" --args ${DATADIR} <mkdownConfig> $USER
	<project-name> the name of the project folder in the DNAm data folder
	<mkdownConfig> path to txt file with parameters for normalisation and which qc checks to perform. Note needs to be absolute path.
	



Approach is as follows:

1. QC across all samples
2. QC within cell type
3. Normalisation
4. Characterise dataset
5. Analysis
