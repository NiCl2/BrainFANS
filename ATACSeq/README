This readme explains the content of the scripts for running the ATAC analysis pipeline

#### Data pre-processing:

1. sbatch JobSubmissionScripts/batchRunATACAlignment.sh <config.txt>

This script searchs within raw data folders for all fastq files
Then submits a batch script to process one sample
	* executes ATACSeq/qcRawData.sh
		* finds paired fastq files
		* runs fastqc
		* runs fastp
		
		
	* executes ATACSeq/alignmentPE.sh 

	* executes ATACSeq/calcENCODEQCMetricsPE.sh ${sampleID}_sorted_chr1.bam
	
	
2. progressReport.sh  <config.txt>
This script identifies how many samples have been successful at each stage of the processing pipeline and for each fastq file, how far through the process it has progressed.

3. sbatch JobSubmissionScripts/batchRunATACPeakCalling.sh <config.txt>
This script searchs within aligned data folders for all bam files
Then submits a batch script to process one sample
	* executes shiftAlignedReadsPE.sh 
		* 
	* executes peakCallingPE.sh
		* which runs MAC peak calling with shifted tagAlign files and with BAM files and paired end reads
	* executes 

3. collateSumStats.r 

#### Misc data preprocessing

mergeFastq.sh
Where a sample was procesed multiple times, the fastq files are merged.
